# project_beaujolais_global_warming

**Introduction:**

In the heart of the picturesque Beaujolais region, we embarked on a comprehensive study to unravel the intricate relationship between global warming and the revered grapevines that produce the region's renowned wines. With a focus on temperature trends, the correlation between key milestones in grapevine development and temperature fluctuations, and the occurrence of snow in this unique terroir, our project aims to shed light on the evolving dynamics of viticulture in the face of climate change.

**Key Points:**

Temperature Trends: Analyzing the steady rise in temperatures, we delve into the impact on grape growth cycles, seeking to understand how warmer conditions influence the delicate balance of flavors in Beaujolais wines.

Timing Correlation: Investigating the correlation between the initiation of crucial grapevine stages and temperature variations, our study uncovers the nuanced relationships that dictate the optimal conditions for grape maturation.

Snow Occurrence: Examining the historical incidence of snow in this traditionally temperate region, we aim to discern patterns that may provide insights into the resilience of Beaujolais grapevines against extreme weather events.

**Predictions for the Future:**

With an eye toward the future, we employ predictive modeling to anticipate how climate change may shape temperature patterns in the Beaujolais region. By extrapolating these findings, we aim to offer valuable insights into the potential trajectories of grape cultivation, allowing stakeholders to adapt and thrive in a changing climate.
